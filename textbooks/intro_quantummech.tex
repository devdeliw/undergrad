\section{The Wave Function}

\subsection{The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation} \mbox{}\\

Imagine a particle of mass $m$, constrained to move along the $x$ axis, subject
to move to some specified force $F(x,t)$. The program of \textit{classical
mechanics} is to determine the position of the particle at any given time
$x(t)$. Once we know that, we can figure out the velocity $(v
= \frac{dx}{dt})$, the momentum $p = mv$, the kinetic energy $(T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2)$,
or any other dynamical variable of interest. To determine $x(t)$, we apply
Newton's Second Law: $F = ma$, or more specifically, $F = -\frac{\partial
V}{\partial x}$, the derivative of a potential energy function, where
$m\frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial t^2} = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$. This
together, with initial conditions, determines $x(t)$. \\\\
Quantum mechanics approaches this same problem a bit differently. In this case
what we're looking for is the particles \textbf{wave function}, $\Phi(x,t)$,
and we get it by solving the \textbf{Schr\"{o}dinger Equation:} 
\\
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = red!5!white, colframe = red!50!black, title
  = Schr\"{o}dinger Equation]

  \[
  i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2
  \Phi}{\partial x^2} + V\Phi
  \] 

\end{tcolorbox} \mbox{}\\


Here $i$ is the square root of $-1$, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant - or
rather, his \textit{original} constant $(h)$ divided by  $2\pi$: 

\[
  \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = 1.054573 \times 10^{-34} J s. 
\] \\

The Schr\"{o}dinger equation plays a role logically analogous to Newton's
second law. \\

\subsection{The Statistical Interpretation} \mbox{}\\


But what exactly \textit{is} this wave function, and what does it do for you
once you've \textit{got} it? After all a particle by nature is a point, whereas
the wave function (as its name suggests) is spread out in space (a function of
$x$, for any given  $t$). 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 10cm]{screenshot 12.png}
    \caption{a "particle" constrained to move in one dimension under the
    influence of a specified force}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 10cm]{screenshot 13.png}
    \caption{a typical wave function. the shaded area represents the
    probability of finding the particle between $a$ and $b$. the particle would
  be relatively likely to be found near  $A$, and unlikely to be found near
$B$.}
\end{figure} 



How can such an object represent the state of a \textit{particle}? The answer
is provided by Born's \textbf{statistical interpretation}, which says that
$|\Psi(x,t)|^2$ gives the \textit{probability} of finding the particle at point
$x$, at time $t$ - or, more precisely, 
\\

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = blue!5!white, colframe = blue!50!black, title
  = Born's Statistical Interpretation]
\[  
\int_{a}^{b} |\Psi(x,t)|^2\,dx = \{ \text{probability of finding particle
between $a$ and $b$, at time $t$ }\} 
\]
\end{tcolorbox} \mbox{}\\

Probability is the \textit{area} under the graph of $|\Psi|^2$. For the wave
function in the figure above, you would be quite likely to find the particle in
the vicinity of point A, where $|\Psi|^2$ is large, and relatively unlikely to
find it near point $B$. \\ \\ 

The statistical interpretation introduces a kind of \textbf{indeterminacy} into
quantum mechanics, for even if you know everything, the theory has to tell you
about the particle, still you can't predict with certainty the outcome of
a simple experiment to predict its position - all quantum mechanics has to
offer is \textit{statistical} information about \textit{possible} results. It
is natural to wonder whether this indeterminacy is a fact of nature, or
a defect in the theory. \\\\

Suppose I \textit{do} measure the position of the particle, and I find it to be
a point $C$. \mbox{}\\ \\

\textbf{\textit{Question}}\\\\
Where was the particle just  \textit{before} I made the measurement? \\\\

\textbf{\textit{Solution}}\\\\
There are three plausible answers \vspace{5px}

\begin{tcolorbox}	
  
  1. The \textbf{realist} position: The \textit{particle was at} $C$. This
     certainly seems reasonable, and it is the response Einstein advocated.
     However, if this is true, quantum mechanics is an \textit{incomplete}
     theory, since the particle \textit{really was} at $C$, and yet quantum
     mechanics was unable to tell us so. 

\end{tcolorbox} \vspace{5px}

\begin{tcolorbox}	
  
  2. The \textbf{orthodox} position: The \textit{particle wasn't really
anywhere}. It was the act of measurement that forced it to "take a stand"
(though how and why it chose the point $C$ we dare not ask). This view is
associated with Bohr and his followers. Among physicists it is the most widely
accepted position. However, if it is correct, a century worth of debate about
the act of measurement has done preciously little to illuminate. 

\end{tcolorbox}	\vspace{5px}

\begin{tcolorbox}	
  
  The \textbf{agnostic} position: \textit{Refuse to answer}. This is not as
  silly as it sounds - what sense can there be in making assertions about the
  status of a particle \textit{before} a measurement. For decades this was the
  "fall-back" position of most physicists: they'd try to sell you the orthodox
  answer, but if you were persistent they'd retreat to the agnostic response,
  and terminate the conversation.

\end{tcolorbox} \vspace{20px}	

However, in 1964, John Bell astonished the physics community by showing that it
makes an \textit{observable} difference whether the particle had a precise
(though unknown) position prior to the measurement or not. Bell's discovery
effectively eliminated agnosticism as a viable option and made it an
\textit{experimental} question whether 1 or 2 was the correct choice. \\\\

What if I made a \textit{second} measurement, immediately after the first?
Would I get $C$ again, or does the act of measurement cough up a completely new
number each time? On this question everyone is in agreement: 

\[
\text{A repeated measurement (on the same particle) must return the same
value}    
\]\\

Indeed, it would be tough to prove the particle was really at $C$ in the first
instance. How does the orthodox interpretation account for the fact that the
second measurement is bound to yield the same result $C$? It must be that the
first measurement radically alters the wave function, so that it now sharply
peaked about $C$. We say that a wave function \textbf{collapses}, upon
measurement, to a spike at the point $C$ (it soon spreads out again, in
accordance with the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, so the second measurement must be
made quickly. 
\vspace{20px}
\begin{figure}[hb!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 10cm]{screenshot 14.png}
    \caption{collapse of the wave function: graph of $|\Psi|^2$ immediately
    \textit{after} a measurement has found the particle at point $C$.}
\end{figure}
\vspace{20px}
There are then, two entirely distinct kinds of physical processes: "ordinary"
ones, in which the wave function evolves in a leisurely fashion under the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and "measurements," in which $\Psi$ suddenly and
discontinuously collapses. 


\subsubsection{Example 1.1} \mbox{}\\

\textbf{Electron Interference}. How might we check that particles (electrons,
for example) have a wave nature, encoded in $\Psi$? \\\\
The classic signature of a wave phenomena is \textit{interference}: two waves
\textit{in phase} interfere constructively, and out of phase they interfere
destructively. The wave nature of light wave confirmed in 1801 by Young's
famous double slit experiment, showing interference "fringes" on a distant
screen when a monochromatic beam passes through two slits. If essentially the
same experiment is done with \textit{electrons}, the same pattern develops,
confirming the wave nature of electrons as more and more electrons collide with
the screen. 

\begin{figure}[hb!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5.5cm]{screenshot 15.png}
    \caption{Build up of electron interference pattern. (a) Eight electrons,
    (b) 270 electrons, (c) 2000 electrons, (d) 160,000 electrons.}
\end{figure}
Of course, if you close off one slit, or somehow contrive to detect which slit
each electron passes through, the interference pattern disappears; the wave
function of the emerging particle is now entirely different.

\vspace{20px}
\section{Probability}
\subsection{Discrete Variables}
\vspace{20px}

Because of statistical interpretation, probability plays a central role in
quantum mechanics, so I digress now for a brief discussion of probability
theory. It is mainly a question of introducing some notation and terminology,
and I shall do it in the context of a simple example: \\\\

Imagine a room containing 14 people, whose ages are: \\\\

\noindent one person aged 14\\
one person aged 15\\
three people aged 16\\
two people aged 22\\
two people aged 24\\
five people aged 25\\\\

If we let $N(j)$ represent the number of people of age $j$, then \\\\
$
N(14) = 1 \\
N(15) = 1 \\
N(16) = 3 \\
N(22) = 2 \\
N(24) = 2 \\
N(25) = 5 \\ \\ 
$
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 10cm]{screenshot 16.png}
    \caption{histogram of people}
\end{figure}

while $N(17)$, for instance, is 0. The total number of people in the room is 

\vspace{5px}\[
  N = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} N(j). 
\] \vspace{5px}


\textbf{\textit{Question}} \vspace{10px} 
If you selected one individual at random from this group, what is the
\textbf{probability} that this person's age would be 15? \vspace{10px}
\textbf{\textit{Solution}} \vspace{10px}
One chance in 14, since there are 14 possible choices, all equally likely, of
whom only one is aged 14. If $P(j)$ is the probability of getting age $j$,
then $P(14) = 1/14, P(15) = 1/14, P(16) = 3/14$, and so one. In general, 

\vspace{5px}\[
P(j) = \frac{N(j)}{N}.
\] \vspace{5px} 

Notice that the probability of getting \textit{either} 14 or 15 is the
\textit{sum} of the individual probabilities (1/7). In particular, the sum of
\textit{all} probabilities is 1 - the person you select must have \textit{some}
age: 

\vspace{5px} \[
\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} P(j) =1
\] \vspace{5px}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = blue!5!white, colframe = blue!50!black, title
= Question]
What is the \textbf{most probable} age? 
\end{tcolorbox} 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = red!5!white, colframe = red!50!black, title
= Solution]
25, obviously, the most probably $j$ is the $j$ for which $P(j)$ is a maximum. 
\end{tcolorbox} 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = blue!5!white, colframe = blue!50!black, title
= Question]
What is the \textbf{median} age?   
\end{tcolorbox} 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = red!5!white, colframe = red!50!black, title
= Solution]
23, for 7 people are younger than 23, and 7 people are older  
\end{tcolorbox} 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = blue!5!white, colframe = blue!50!black, title
= Question]
What is the \textbf{median} age?
\end{tcolorbox} 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = red!5!white, colframe = red!50!black, title
= Solution]
\[
\frac{14 + 15 + 3(16) + 2(22) + 2(24) + 5(25)}{14} = \frac{294}{14} = 21.
\]
